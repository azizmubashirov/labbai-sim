 * LOCK ORDER: `organization-mutation:<org>` → `user-billing-identity:<user>` →

 * and only AFTER live membership has been confirmed, so a caller who turns out
 * not to belong to the organization never serializes against its admins.
 *
 * It is also taken after the organization's own revalidation — the `FOR UPDATE`
 * subscription re-read and the owner lookup — so an org-wide key that every
 * permission-group admin write contends on is not held across a blocking row
 * lock that can wait out the full `lock_timeout`. Only the capability read and
 * the caller's inserts need its protection. The refusal order shifts with it:
 * an organization that BOTH lapsed and withholds the capability now reports the
